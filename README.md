# M1_Arithmatic-Calculator




# Introduction:-   
 Arithmatic-Calculator is a device that performs arithmetic operations on numbers. The simplest calculators can do only addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. More sophisticated calculators can handle exponent ial operations, roots, logarithm s, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions. Internally, some calculators actually perform all of these functions by repeated processes of addition.

The input includes the command such as we can give numbers based on the operation for example for addition we give 1 as a command and that particular operation works.Moreover, this calculator is smart enough to operate multiplication/division before addition/subtraction/factorial/power/modulas, in another word it is implemented with the
order of precedence logic.
